# Distributed Autonomous Governance

To begin, let's just throw some of the initial ideas into this readme.

## Basic Premise:
1. Governing is difficult, broad, and huge. Can tech be used to make it 
  a) distributed,
  b) autonomous
  c) and actually work for most of the people most of the time?

## Things to keep in mind
1. This repo is publically available and the rhetoric should reflect that.
2. Let's for now just focus on the technical aspects of governance.

## Broad range of topics to cover:
1. Technically well-defined case study (?) to which some of these (technical) ideas can be applied.
2. No governance = chaos? See: & study Belgium, Spain example(s).
3. Purpose(s?) of government. Create and enforce laws. 
4. Human rights. A yardstick for good governance.
5. 
6.
7.
